    <h2>Sponsorship Opportunities</h2>

    <p>
    FEMTEC 2013 is a not-for-profit conference whose mission 
    is to promote modern technologies and practices in scientific computing 
    and visualization, as well as strengthen the interaction 
    between researchers and 
    practitioners in all areas of computational engineering 
    and sciences. In order to keep the conference fees low and to
    encourage participation, we solicit conference sponsorship 
    at varying levels. Primary sponsorship will be used to defray 
    travel costs for speakers and attendees as well as facilities 
    costs. Supporting sponsorship will contribute to various 
    aspects of the conference. 
    </p>

    <h2>Who attends?</h2>

    <p>
    The FEMTEC conference is increasingly popular and the number of 
    participants doubles every time. The conference is attended 
    by researchers and practitioners from various areas of scientific 
    computing and visualization. Many participants are also 
    instructors at colleges and universities. The size of FEMTEC 2013 
    is limited to 200 attendees by the capacity of the Stratosphere 
    Casino Tower. This year we expect the interest to vastly exceed 
    the quota which will ensure exceptionally high quality of speakers 
    and presentations.
