    <h2>List of Minisymposia</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Numerical modeling of metamaterials (Jichun Li, UNLV)</b><br>
        The aim of this minisymposium is to exchange
        ideas and further explore some major challenges and approaches to
        numerical modeling of wave propagation in metamaterials, including
        numerical studies of nonlinear metamaterials, multiscale modeling,
        material parameters retrieval, optimization algorithms and
        applications of metamaterials. </li>
        <li><b>Coupled problems in electromagnetics (Pavel Karban, UWB)</b><br>
        The aim of this minisymposium is to present and discuss state-of-the-art
        mathematical models, numerical methods, and computational techniques for 
        solving multiphysics coupled problems rooted in electromagnetic fields.
        Target applications include induction and dielectric heating, electromechanical 
        transducers, and high-voltage phenomena of thermoelasticity.
    </ul>

If you are interested in organizing a minisymposium, please send a tentative title and 
a brief description to {{ conf_email }}.
