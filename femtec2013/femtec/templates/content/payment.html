    <p>
    In an attempt to keep the participant cost low, we preserved the 
    registration fees from 2011:

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Registration fee</td>

        <td>Received after March 15, 2013</td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Regular participants</td>
                <td>350 USD</td>
                <td>550 USD</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
