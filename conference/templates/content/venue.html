    <h2>Conference Venue</h2>

    <p>
        Pilsen is a beautiful historical city whose origins date back to the 13th
        century. On 6 May 1945, near the end of World War II, it was liberated 
        from the Nazis by the 16th Armored Division of General Patton's 3rd Army. 
        An overview of the rich Pilsen's history can be found on its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plze%C5%88">Wikipedia page</a>.
        The city features many sightseeing attractions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The conference will take place in the historical
        <a href="http://www.plzensky-prazdroj.cz/en/come-and-visit/pilsen-brewery/lease-of-premises">conference center Secese</a>
        of the Pilsner Urquell Brewery, and catering will be provided by the famous brewery restaurant
        <a href="http://www.plzensky-prazdroj.cz/en/come-and-visit/pilsen-brewery/na-spilce-restaurant">Na Spilce</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Part of the conference program will be optional tours of the
        <a href="http://www.plzensky-prazdroj.cz/en/come-and-visit/pilsen-brewery/brewery-museum-tour">Pilsner Urquell brewery museum</a>,
        <a href="http://www.plzenskepodzemi.cz/en/">historical undergrounds of Pilsen</a>, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_St._Bartholomew_(Plze%C5%88)">St. Bartholomeus Cathedral</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Travel Information</h2>

    <p>
        Conference registration will open at 2 pm in the lobby of the hotel Angelo Pilsen on Sunday June 15, 2014. Dinner will be provided for those who do not arrive too late (the restaurant stops serving dinner at 9 pm).
    </p>

    <h4>Using a train from Prague</h4>

    <p>
        This is a recommended way of transportation as the Angelo Hotel is located approx. 400 m from the
        Pilsen Railway Station. The trains leave from the Prague Main Railway Station
        (Praha Hlavni Nadrazi) often and the trip takes less than 3 hours. When coming through the Prague
        Airport, use the <a href="http://czech-transport.com/index.php?id=357">Airport Express</a> shuttle
        service which takes you there directly. When coming from other parts of the city, the Main Railway
        Station is a stop of the red line "C" of Prague subway. Train tickets can be purchased in the lobby
        of the railway station, or directly in the train (higher fees apply).
    </p>
