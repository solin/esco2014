    <h2>List of Minisymposia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Coupled problems in electromagnetics (P. Karban, UWB)</b><br>
        The aim of this minisymposium is to present and discuss state-of-the-art
        mathematical models, numerical methods, and computational techniques for 
        solving multiphysics coupled problems rooted in electromagnetic fields.
        Target applications include induction and dielectric heating, electromechanical 
        transducers, and high-voltage phenomena of thermoelasticity.
        </li>
        <li><b>Advances in Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for complex wave
        propagation problems (S. Schnepp, ETH Zurich)</b><br>
        This  minisymposium is
        concerned  with  advances  and  novel DG  techniques  for  the
        computer   simulation   of    complex   wave   propagation   problems.
        Contributions  on  methodological advances  -  such  as hybridized  DG
        methods, efficient time integration, error estimation and adaptivity -
        or  the  modeling  of  complex  situations and  materials  -  such  as
        encountered in nano-sciences,  bioelectromagnetics or coupled problems
        - are most welcome. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Applications of FEM in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Physics  (M. Braun, 
        University of South Africa)</b><br>
        The aim  of this minisymposium is to exchange and discuss ideas for
        the application of the finite element method
        in theoretical chemistry and computational physics. The main focus will
        be on methods to solve the three dimensional
        Schroedinger type equations that result from Hartree Fock /  Density
        Functional and similar approaches applied to
        small and medium sized molecules and/or periodic solids. It is hoped,
        that researchers from different groups working
        on this and related topics will benefit from the interaction and
        possible collaborative projects emanating from this minisymposium.
        </li>
        <li><b>Uncertainty Quantification in Security Science (A. Luttman and E. Machorro, National 
        Security Technologies)</b><br>
        Security science" is the name given to basic and applied research whose primary mission 
        is to drive national security policy and decisions based on rigorous scientific analysis. 
        Among the most important problems in security science is to quantify the uncertainty associated 
        with the computational results that are delivered to policymakers. In this session the speakers 
        will present research on computational approaches to uncertainty quantification in linear and 
        nonlinear inverse problems, graph network analysis, experimentation diagnostic analysis, and 
        imaging science.
        </li>
        <li><b>Recent Developments in Adaptivity and A Posteriori Error Analysis (P. Houston, University of Nottingham; 
        T. Barth, NASA AMES; M. Larson, Umea University)</b><br>
        The exploitation of computable a posteriori error bounds within adaptive mesh-refinement 
        strategies is of fundamental importance to guarantee the reliable and efficient numerical 
        simulation of mathematical models arising in computational science and engineering. The 
        objective of this minisymposium is to present recent work undertaken in this field; in 
        particular, topics of interest will include: dual-weighted-residual error estimation, 
        adaptive model reduction, error estimation of time-dependent problems, and 
        hp-adaptive refinement strategies.
        </li>
        <li><b>Numerical modeling of metamaterials (J. Li, UNLV)</b><br>
        The aim of this minisymposium is to exchange
        ideas and further explore some major challenges and approaches to
        numerical modeling of wave propagation in metamaterials, including
        numerical studies of nonlinear metamaterials, multiscale modeling,
        material parameters retrieval, optimization algorithms and
        applications of metamaterials. </li>
