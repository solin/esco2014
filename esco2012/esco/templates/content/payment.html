    <h3>Wire Transfer</h3>

The preferred and most secure way of payment is via wire transfer. Please <b>make sure that 
all bank fees are paid by the sender</b>, otherwise we will have to ask you to 
pay the balance in cash at the time of registration. Since the textual information accompanying 
the wire transfer is often lost, we need a <b>scanned copy of your payment receipt</b> to 
correctly identify your payment. The bank information is as follows:<br>
